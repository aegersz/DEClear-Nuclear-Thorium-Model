## 🔍 Labeled Components (Top to Bottom)

1. **🛡️ Polymer Casing with Lead Shield**  
   - Triple-layered outer shell that blocks radiation and protects internal components.

2. **⚙️ Palladium Electrode (Top)**  
   - Conductive contact surface, facilitating controlled energy transfer and collection.

3. **🔷 SiO₂ Crystal Matrix**  
   - Upper dielectric layer; stores charge capacitively using its strong lattice and insulation properties.

4. **🧱 Bentonite Separator**  
   - Porous clay layer that electrically isolates while allowing controlled ion exchange and radiation dampening.

5. **🛢️ Thorium-Rich Mineral Oil** *(Corrected from "Tnlrionium-Pimeral Oil")*  
   - Dense dielectric fluid infused with low-radiation Thorium compounds for passive decay capture and charge mediation.

6. **⚙️ Palladium Electrode (Bottom)**  
   - Final conductive terminal connecting to output or smart charger interface.

## 🛠️ Notes

- The "**Thorium-Rich Mineral Oil** acts as a **passive nuclear energy interface**, stabilizing and storing charge released from natural decay (mostly alpha particles from Thorium-232).
- The corrected schematic file is suitable for GitHub repositories, pitch decks, and grant applications.
