# ⚡ DEClear: Digital Energy Cell – Clean Edition

**🧠 Inventor:** Andrew Egerszegi  
**📄 Status:** Ready for Provisional Patent Application (PPA)  
**🌏 Filed from:** Australia  
**🛠️ Project Alias:** DEClear (Digital Energy Cell – Clear Edition)  
**🔐 IP Class:** Capacitive nuclear-integrated energy storage (non-fission, solid-state)  

---

## ✨ Executive Summary

**DEClear** is a clean, modular evolution of the original **DEC**, designed for **safe, passive nuclear integration** without the hazards of fission. It utilizes:

- **☢️ Thorium-rich oil blends**  
- **🪨 SiO₂ crystal matrices**  
- **🧱 Bentonite clay separators**

This enables long-term energy storage through **capacitive dielectric absorption**, not chain reactions. It is **solid-state**, **non-critical**, and **inherently safe** — making it a compelling nuclear-adjacent technology for a post-fission world.

## 🧪 Core Materials

- **🔬 Dielectric 1:** Crystalline SiO₂ (Quartz, Fused Silica)  
- **🛢️ Dielectric 2:** Thorium-rich mineral oil or PEG-Thorium blend  
- **🧱 Separator:** Bentonite clay (charged and porous)  
- **⚙️ Electrodes:** Palladium (Pd), Silver (Ag), or Graphene composite  
- **🧯 Encapsulation:** Polymer case with optional lead-foil radiation shield
