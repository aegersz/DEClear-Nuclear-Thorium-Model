# üìò DEClear ‚Äì Glossary of Terms

**DEClear**: Digital Energy Cell ‚Äì Clean Edition. A non-fission, solid-state nuclear-adjacent energy storage device based on dielectric absorption, not chain reactions.

### üî¨ Core Materials

- **SiO‚ÇÇ (Silicon Dioxide)**: A stable, crystalline dielectric material used to store charge. In DEClear, it forms the top dielectric layer.
- **Thorium-rich Oil**: Mineral or PEG-based oil infused with natural thorium, which emits low-energy radiation that DEClear can absorb capacitively.
- **Bentonite Clay**: A natural swelling clay with high ion exchange capacity, acting as a separator and radiation buffer.
- **Palladium Electrodes**: Corrosion-resistant, conductive plates used to facilitate energy input/output.
- **PEG (Polyethylene Glycol)**: Optional dielectric or coolant layer, especially in DEClear-PEG.
- **Polymer Casing**: The non-reactive outer shell, optionally layered with lead foil for shielding.
- **Capacitive Storage**: Energy storage by accumulating electric charge in a dielectric material, distinct from chemical or nuclear fission energy.

### üõ†Ô∏è Concepts

- **Non-Fission Nuclear Energy**: Capturing ambient radiation or decay without initiating a chain reaction.
- **Solid-State Energy System**: No moving parts, turbines, or fluids circulating for heat. Uses static fields and dielectrics.
- **Breeder Cell**: In context, not producing fissile fuel but capturing long-lived decay energy in a reusable format.
- **Alpha/Beta Radiation Absorption**: DEClear captures low-level emissions for storage instead of shielding them as waste.
