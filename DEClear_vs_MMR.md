---

## ✅ Similarities

| Feature                     | DEClear                           | MMR                               |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 🔋 Modular Design           | Yes – units stack like batteries  | Yes – deployable container units  |
| ☢️ Uses Thorium             | Yes – in oil blend                 | Sometimes – depends on model      |
| 🌍 Off-grid Ready           | Yes                               | Yes                               |
| 🔒 Safety-Oriented          | Yes – no chain reaction            | Yes – passive safety systems      |
| 🧊 No Water Cooling Needed  | Yes                               | Some models, yes                  |

## ❌ Differences

| Category                 | DEClear                                       | MMR                                              |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ⚛️ Nuclear Mechanism     | Passive decay capture (no reaction)           | Active fission chain reaction                    |
| 🔬 Output Type           | Pure electric via capacitance                 | Heat > turbine > electricity                     |
| 🧯 Meltdown Risk         | None – solid-state dielectric system          | Low but present – fission-based                  |
| ⚙️ Moving Parts          | None                                          | Usually has turbines or coolant loops            |
| 📏 Scale                 | Small to medium (domestic + substation)       | Medium to large (small cities or industry)       |
| 📜 Regulation            | Easier – not classified as a reactor          | Strict – reactor class, nuclear licensing needed |
| 💰 Commercial Barrier    | Lower – easier to prototype, store, deploy    | Higher – requires infrastructure & legal backing |

## 💡 Summary

While MMRs attempt to miniaturize nuclear reactors safely, DEClear **redefines nuclear-adjacent energy** by avoiding reactions altogether. It’s more **battery-like**, safer, and designed for **mass adoption** without requiring nuclear infrastructure.
